# Library-Management-Software---Python-Project

The datasets folder also had two more files: The complete 'books.csv' and 'Books_rating.csv'. Due to their size (75mb and 2.7gb respectively), they are not included in this repository.

There were 3 modes for which dataset to load in the system: Minimal - Lite - Full. Only Minimal and Lite have been included in this repository, as the Full model (50k users, 1k admins, 100k books) is to large to include (600mb).

In each dataset model, two custom entries have been added for convinience: [username: user - password: 123], and [username: admin - password: 123].
These entries have been manually set to bypass the usual password restrictions. They provide an easy way to expore both user-related commands and admin-specific commands with an easy log in method.
